This game was built using PyGame and Discrete principles for a project in my Discrete class.

## Some things that could be improved
* Don't let the enemies get stuck trying to make the same move over and over
* Don't let the enemies spawn in the starting corner
* Make sure it is always possible to win
* Add a starting menu which displays the high score
